# 👾 wmIP_v3

> This release of ***what's my IP*** is more like a *light* version of the script.
>
> It does nothing fancy, it's a small (it's actually my first ☺) *golang* program/script, it makes an API call and receives the ***public IP***.



### Usage 👨‍💻

The program is already compiled (*build/wmip*), so it's ready to use.

1. cd into the *build* directory: `$ cd build`
2. execute the program: `$ ./wmip`
3. That's it 🎉

You should now have 2 new files.

One called `$ ./wmip.log`, this file contains all the logs.

And the other one, `$ ./ip.txt`, in here is the public ip stored.



### Note 📓

It was compiled in **Linux**, it was tested in **Linux**. 🐧

I think it will work with *Windows* or *MacOS*, if not, please let me know.
